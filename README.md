# Garrett Lisi's Theory Of Everything
The Spinning Pattern: This represents a 2D projection of E8's 248-dimensional root system. Think of it like looking at the shadow of a incredibly complex crystal - you can't see all dimensions, but you can glimpse its symmetry.
Colored Particles:

Orange dots (quarks & leptons) - the matter particles
Blue dots (gauge bosons) - force-carrying particles like photons
Yellow dots (gravity) - theoretical gravitational particles
Purple dots (E8 roots) - the underlying geometric structure

The 8-fold Symmetry: Notice the 8 radial lines - E8 has this special 8-fold rotational symmetry that's central to why Lisi chose this particular mathematical structure.
Interactive Controls

Rotation Speed: Control how fast the structure rotates through higher dimensions
Zoom Level: Get closer to see individual "particles" or pull back for the big picture
Projection Angle: Manually rotate to see different cross-sections of the 248D structure
Mouse Movement: Move your mouse over the visualization to subtly influence the rotation

The Physics Connection
This visualization helps you understand Lisi's core insight: if all particles are just different orientations or excitations of one geometric object, then all of physics becomes geometry. When you see the dots moving in coordinated patterns, imagine that each represents a different fundamental particle, all connected through the symmetries of this single mathematical structure.
The beautiful part is that even though the math doesn't quite work out for a complete theory of everything, E8 really does have these stunning symmetries that create gorgeous patterns when visualized.
The second canvas now shows E8 particles creating worldlines through 4-dimensional spacetime. This is how physicists actually think about particle motion - not just where particles are, but their entire history through space and time.
Key Features:
Worldlines as Tubes: Each glowing trail shows a particle's complete journey through spacetime. The trails get fainter as they represent older positions in time.
Time as Height: As time passes, particles move "upward" in the time dimension. The visualization rotates to show this 4D structure from different angles.
Interactive 3D Rotation: Click and drag on the spacetime canvas to rotate the 4D sculpture and see it from different perspectives.
Present Moment: The bright glowing dots are the "present moment" - where each particle currently exists. Everything behind them is their history.
Spacetime Grid: The faint circular grids represent "time slices" - snapshots of all space at different moments in time.
The Physics Connection
This visualization demonstrates a profound concept from Einstein's relativity: everything that has ever happened or will happen already exists in the 4D "block universe." Your past, present, and future are all equally real - they're just different locations along your worldline.
In Lisi's E8 theory, these worldlines would emerge from the geometric rotations and symmetries of the single E8 structure. Each particle's motion through spacetime would be determined by how the E8 geometry evolves.
Controls:

All the original sliders affect both visualizations
Mouse interaction: Hover over the first canvas to influence rotation, drag on the second canvas to rotate the 4D view
Reset button: Now clears both visualizations
The 4D view slowly auto-rotates to show different perspectives
